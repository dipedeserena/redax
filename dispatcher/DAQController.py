DAQ Controller Brain Class
D. Coderre, 12. Mar. 2019
D. Masson, 06 Apr 2020

Brief: This code handles the logic of what the dispatcher does when. It takes in
aggregated status updates and commands from the mongo connector and decides if
any action needs to be taken to get the DAQ into the target state. It also handles the
resetting of runs (the ~hourly stop/start) during normal operations.

    def SolveProblem(self, latest_status, goal_state):
        '''
        This is sort of the whole thing that all the other code is supporting
        We get the status from the DAQ and the command from the user
        Then one of three things can happen:
             1) The status agrees with the command. We're in the goal state and happy.
             2) The status differs from the command. We issue the necessary commands
                to put the system into the goal state
             3) The status and goal are irreconcilable. We complain with an error
                because we can't find any way to put the system into the goal state.
                This could be because a key component is either in error or not present
                at all. Or it could be because we are trying to, for example, start a calibration
                run in the neutron veto but it is already running a combined run and
                therefore unavailable. The frontend should prevent many of these cases though.

        The way that works is this:
        A) the detector should be INACTIVE (i.e., IDLE), we stop the detector if the status is in one of the active states
        B) the detector should be ACTIVE (i.e, RUNNING), we issue the necessary commands to put the system in the RUNNING status
        C) we deal separately with the ERROR and TIMEOUT statuses, as in the first time we need to promptly stop the detector, and in the second case we need to handle the timeouts.
